"""Read the number of tests `pytest --collect-only` collected.

Ported verbatim from ai-bot-platform (`.github/scripts/census_count.py`, DRF-1349)
on 2026-09-11 as the first half of sharding this repository's CI: a shard
layout needs a census to be summed against, and a census needs a parser that
is itself under test. This repository's `pytest.ini` addopts carry only
`--strict-markers`, so `--collect-only -q` yields quiet level 1 here — the
form that prints a total line — but the step still pins verbosity rather than
relying on that, for the reason below.

WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT A HEREDOC IN ci.yml.

It used to be inline in the `apps/ collection census` step. Inline code is
code nothing can run a test against, and this parser is a guard: if it
misreads, the shard-sum check downstream either blocks a good run or, worse,
waves through a run that collected nothing. So it lives here, and
`tests/test_census_parser.py` feeds it real captured pytest output.

THE TWO FORMS, AND WHY BOTH ARE NEEDED.

`--collect-only` output depends on the QUIET LEVEL, which is cumulative:

  quiet 1 (`-q`)   node ids, then `13177/13203 tests collected (26 deselected)`
  quiet 2 (`-qq`)  per-file counts (`apps/x/tests/test_y.py: 30`), NO total

In the bot repository the census step once asked for `-q` on a project
whose `pyproject.toml` addopts already carried `-q`. The two
added up to quiet level 2, the total line vanished, and the guard reported
`CENSUS UNREADABLE` — correctly refusing, but for a reason nobody could read.

The step no longer adds its own `-q`, so form 1 is what CI actually gets.
Form 2 is still parsed, because the failure above was caused by a verbosity
level nobody set on purpose, and that can happen again from the other side —
someone changing addopts. Both forms yield the SAME number: per-file counts
are post-deselect, measured against the same suite as the total line.

WHY QUIET LEVEL 1 IS REQUIRED, NOT MERELY TIDIER.

`CENSUS EMPTY` must stay a distinct outcome from `CENSUS UNREADABLE` — an
empty census is the exact silent-green disaster the census exists to catch.
At quiet 2, a run that collects nothing prints NOTHING AT ALL and exits 0, so
zero and unparseable are the same observable and the distinction is lost. At
quiet 1 pytest prints `no tests collected`, which this parser reads as an
explicit 0. That is why the step's verbosity is pinned rather than left to
add up.
