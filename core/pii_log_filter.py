"""Фильтр ПДн для логов каталога — порт ``PIIRedactingFilter`` бота (DRF-2272).

Источник: ai-bot-platform ``apps/observability/pii_filter.py`` (DRF-859,
DRF-1380), логика перенесена без изменений, чтобы оба журнала маскировали
одинаково: телефон → ``[PHONE]``, e-mail → ``[EMAIL]``, карта (Луна) →
``[CARD]``. Логи контейнеров каталога переезжают в journald хоста и живут
дольше выкладки, поэтому фильтр стоит на каждом постоянном обработчике.

Описание бота:

PII-redacting log filter (DRF-859 / Phase 1 / PI8).

Defence-in-depth on top of the Sentry PII scrubber
(:func:`apps.observability.sentry.scrub_event` — Sprint 8 / E1) and the
Replay regex redactor (:class:`apps.replay.redactor.Redactor` — Sprint 5).

### Why a second layer

The Sentry scrubber only touches Sentry-bound events. The platform also
writes structured JSON logs (J-track, Sprint 8 / J1) to stdout / file /
journald — those bypass Sentry entirely. A misconfigured logger could
leak ``+7 905 123 4567``, ``client@example.com``, or
``4111 1111 1111 1111`` into a log file readable by audit + ops.

152-ФЗ obligation: personal data (phone, email) must not be retained
outside the consented surface. Logs are not a consented surface; this
filter scrubs phone / email / credit-card at *write* time, before any
formatter or handler emits the record.

### Layering with the Sentry scrubber

* **Sentry**: events shipped upstream → Sentry SDK ``before_send`` runs
  :func:`apps.observability.sentry.scrub_event`. We do **not** also wire
  this filter into the Sentry handler — double-redaction risks corrupting
  already-redacted placeholders ("[PHONE]" running through phone regex
  is fine, but the audit story is cleaner if each output path has one
  scrubber).
* **JSON / console / file handlers** (this filter): all persistent
  destinations get :class:`PIIRedactingFilter` so a stray
  ``logger.info("phone: %s", "+7...")`` never reaches disk.

### What is redacted

* **Russian phone numbers** — ``+7``/``8`` prefix + 10 digits with
  optional separators (space, dash, parens), bounded so the run is not
  welded to an ASCII letter or another digit (DRF-1380: without the
  letter guard the pattern sliced the middle out of hex identifiers).
  US/international numbers are out of scope (low signal in a
  Russia-only deployment, and the RU format catches the bulk of
  operational chatter).
* **Emails** — standard pattern; conservative on edge cases (e.g. bare
  ``@username`` is not redacted).
* **Credit cards** — 13-19 consecutive digits (optionally split into
  groups of 4 with space/dash separators), validated via Luhn
  *inside the substitution callback*. The Luhn gate is critical: 16-
  digit YClients ``record_id``s would otherwise be redacted on every
  log line and break observability.

### What is NOT redacted (deliberately, in this PR)

* **Names** — NER (e.g. Russian first names like "Лена", "Иван") has
  high false-positive risk because common names overlap with regular
  vocabulary. Deferred to a future filter that can layer on top.
* **Whitelisted opaque IDs** — :data:`_OPAQUE_ID_KEYS` plus any dict
  key ending in ``_id`` or ``_uuid``. These are identifiers, not PII;
  redacting them breaks observability.

### Performance

The hot path is one ``%`` operation away from every log call. Budget:
< 1 ms per record. Optimisations:

* All regexes compiled at import time (class attributes).
* Cheap short-circuit: if the record carries no digit AND no ``@``,
  skip all regex evaluation.
* Credit-card validation lives **inside** the substitution callback so
  non-Luhn 16-digit sequences (the hot path — YClients ``record_id``,
  ``payment_id``) bail out before any replacement allocates.

Benchmark in :mod:`apps.observability.tests.test_pii_filter` asserts
10k records in < 10 s (= < 1 ms each on average).

# Compiled regex patterns (compiled once at import time).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Russian phone numbers: ``+7`` or ``8`` prefix, then 10 digits with optional
# separators. The negative lookbehind/lookahead prevents the pattern from
# eating digits that happen to neighbour a long opaque id.
#
# The boundary guards exclude ASCII letters as well as digits (DRF-1380).
# ``(?<!\d)`` alone let the pattern start inside a hex identifier: in
# ``draft_id=3f2a84113328793b`` the ``a`` is not a digit, so ``8`` opened a
# match and the redactor cut ``84113328793`` out of the middle of the id.
# Measured at 0.19% of random UUIDs — roughly one identifier in 530 —
# which is exactly the identifier an operator searches for when an
# incident is being traced. A phone number is never written flush against
# an ASCII letter, so the guard costs nothing on the real forms below
# (verified against every form in the list, in 19 surrounding contexts);
# non-ASCII letters are deliberately still allowed on both sides, so a
# number abutting Cyrillic text is caught exactly as before.
#
# The regex is NOT relaxed here: a missed phone number in a log is worse
# than a mangled identifier, so the pattern itself stays as greedy as it
# was and only the boundary tightens.
#
# Matches:
#   +7 (905) 123-45-67    +79051234567    8 905 123 45 67    8-905-123-45-67
# Does NOT match:
#   +1 555 123 4567       (non-RU prefix, scope decision)
#   12345678901           (no +7/8 prefix on the front)
#   3f2a84113328793b      (digit run welded to ASCII letters — an id)

#
# Anchored with lookarounds so it doesn't slice the middle of a 20-digit
# uuid-fragment / opaque id.
#
# The boundary guards exclude ASCII letters as well as digits, for the
# same reason as _PHONE_RE above (DRF-1380): the Luhn gate alone does
# not save identifiers, because a 13-19 digit run carved out of a UUID
# passes Luhn once in a while, and the id then loses its middle:
#
#   15835949-2147-4d47-bb62-2539e07b3fec -> [CARD]d47-bb62-2539e07b3fec
#
# Measured at 0.224% of random UUIDs before the guard, 0.007% after.
#
# 0.007% is NOT zero, and the residue has a known, single cause: the
# dash-separated groups of a canonical UUID can themselves line up into
# a Luhn-valid 13-19 digit run whose ends fall on dashes, where no
# letter guard can reach:
#
#   320ba56a-8c75-4765-9175-452210217959 -> 320ba56a-8c75-4765-[CARD]
#
# It is confined to that shape: dash-free 32-char hex ids measure 0 out
# of 200 000, canonical dashed ids 28 out of 200 000 (0.014%).
#
# Closing that residue needs a different mechanism than a boundary
# guard (e.g. refusing to redact inside something already shaped like a
# UUID); it is deliberately left open here rather than papered over.
